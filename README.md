# TransitNav

**Clarity in Motion** — TransitNav is a location-aware web application that helps commuters determine the best place to sit on a train to minimize walking and exit time. Whether you're navigating subway systems or regional rail like GO Transit in Southern Ontario, TransitNav gives you optimized seating advice based on your destination and transit line.

---

## 🚇 Overview

TransitNav enhances public transit efficiency by letting users:

- Enter their destination or transit stop.
- Automatically detect their current system and line (e.g. TTC, GO Transit).
- View the optimal train car or door to board for quickest exit at their stop.
- Get visual overlays on system maps showing seating recommendations.

The goal: reduce friction in commutes and maximize travel efficiency with smart, context-aware routing.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 **Location Inference** – Uses geolocation to determine nearby transit systems and stations.
- 🗺️ **System Map Integration** – Fetches relevant subway or rail maps for visual guidance.
- 🧭 **Exit Proximity Engine** – Calculates optimal train car based on stop layout and exit locations.
- 📱 **Mobile-first Design** – Built with React for smooth, responsive mobile use.
- 🌐 **Extensible Back-End** – (Planned) Integration with crowdsourced data or APIs for system updates.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React (with Tailwind or your preferred CSS framework)
- **Backend**: Flask (planned for map inference and system logic)
- **APIs**: Geolocation API, Transit system metadata (static for MVP, dynamic in future)
- **Hosting**: Heroku, Netlify, or Vercel (TBD)
